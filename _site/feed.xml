<p><img src="/assets/images/Cover_Google Interview.png" alt="Interview with Google" width="800" /></p>

<p>A few months ago, I had the opportunity to complete the final round of interviews for an Analytical Consultant position at Google in Germany. It was a meaningful and well-structured four-stage process that followed an initial CV screening.</p>

<p>Interviewing at top-tier tech companies like Google is often seen as both challenging and rewarding. For me, it turned out to be more than just a hiring process‚Äîit became a mirror that helped me refine how I present my work, think through problems, and operate under pressure in a virtual setting. Each stage shed light on a different aspect of my skills and prompted me to reflect on how I communicate, stay composed, and adapt in real time.</p>

<div style="height: 2px; background-color: lightgray; margin: 40px 0;"></div>

<!------------------------------ STAGE 1 ----------------------------------->

<h1 id="round-1">Stage 1: Initial Engagement</h1>

<p>The journey began with an online conversation with a Google HR representative. We discussed how my professional background aligned with the role, my longer-term career aspirations, and my motivation for applying. I also appreciated getting a clearer sense of the team‚Äôs expectations and what working at Google might be like.</p>

<p>Soon after, I was invited to proceed to the next stage: a series of three technical interviews, scheduled over three consecutive days. Each session lasted 45 minutes and typically included 4‚Äì5 core questions, exploring theoretical understanding, practical applications, and real-world scenarios. Preparing for this stage required focused effort, especially in organizing my experiences into a clear and compelling professional narrative.</p>

<!------------------------------ STAGE 2 ----------------------------------->

<h1 id="round-2">Stage 2: Exploring Technical Foundations</h1>

<p>This stage focused on my domain expertise in Data Analytics, Sales, and Digital Marketing. The interviewer referred to specific points on my CV, leading to an in-depth discussion about a major project I had worked on, followed up with related technical and conceptual questions.</p>

<p>There was also a short SQL assessment ‚Äî nothing too advanced, but enough to require some solid preparation. Beyond that, I answered scenario-based questions that tested my understanding of Digital Marketing principles and the Online Advertising ecosystem.</p>

<p>What stood out to me was that even seemingly simple questions could feel open-ended. The real challenge wasn‚Äôt just answering but organizing my responses with structure and confidence. Clearly framing my thought process often mattered more than aiming for the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù response.</p>

<!------------------------------ STAGE 3 ----------------------------------->

<h1 id="round-3">Stage 3: Case Analysis and Problem-Solving</h1>

<p>This round was designed to assess my analytical thinking and problem-solving in context. After a brief introduction, I was presented with case studies touching on Sales, Online Advertising, and Digital Strategy. Each scenario involved a business challenge and required outlining potential actions and realistic solutions in a structured way.</p>

<p>The cases themselves weren‚Äôt unfamiliar, but the expectations were high. The interviewers weren‚Äôt just looking for a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answer ‚Äî they wanted to see how I approached the problem, broke it down, and reasoned through it step by step.</p>

<p>This round also reinforced the importance of understanding industry terms like CTR, CPA, and ROI. Staying calm, thinking aloud, and mapping out a structured response made a big difference. Overall, it became clear that the process of arriving at an answer was just as important as the answer itself.</p>

<!------------------------------ STAGE 4 ----------------------------------->

<h1 id="round-4">Stage 4: Understanding "Googleyness" and Situational Responses</h1>

<p>The final round was focused on behavioral questions and soft skills ‚Äî essentially, how I handle real-world challenges, from interpersonal issues to high-pressure situations. This stage felt like a test of soft skills, communication style, adaptability, and cultural fit. The questions often involved hypothetical or past work situations. Common themes include navigating interpersonal challenges, resolving conflicts, managing pressure, and responding to setbacks.</p>

<p>I used the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to stay organized in my responses, especially when questions came with layered follow-ups. In cases where I hadn‚Äôt faced an identical situation, I tried to draw parallels from similar experiences, staying honest and grounded in my responses. Maintaining a composed, positive, and engaged attitude felt most appropriate.</p>

<p>This was the stage where authenticity mattered most. While technical precision was key earlier, here it was about listening, communicating, and building understanding‚Äîstaying composed and true to my working style helped me navigate it with more ease.</p>

<!------------------------------ EVALUATION ----------------------------------->
<hr style="width: 40%; border: none; border-top: 1px dashed lightgray; margin: 40px auto;" />

<h1 id="evaluation">üéØ The Evaluation Process</h1>

<p>After the interviews, my performance was evaluated by a hiring committee and benchmarked against internal criteria. These criteria vary by role and seniority level. While overall feedback was positive, my problem-solving depth was assessed as landing between an L3 and L4 level.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I was offered an L3 role‚Äîtypically aligned with early-career professionals who have a few years of experience. Although the position I had initially applied for was scoped at a more senior level, I appreciated the transparency from the team. They acknowledged my aspirations and shared that they would stay in touch regarding future opportunities that might be a stronger match in terms of level and responsibilities.</p>

<!------------------------------ FINAL  ----------------------------------->
<div style="height: 2px; background-color: lightgray; margin: 40px 0;"></div>
<h1 id="final">üìå Final Thoughts</h1>

<p>This experience has left a lasting impression on me ‚Äî not just because of the company name, but because of the rigor and intentionality of the process. Each stage challenged a different part of my skill set and helped me see my strengths and blind spots with greater clarity. While the outcome didn‚Äôt unfold exactly as I had imagined, I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity and the professional insights gained along the way.</p>

<p>The process reminded me that interviewing isn‚Äôt only about receiving an offer ‚Äî it‚Äôs also about learning how we show up, how we grow, and how we move forward with a clearer sense of what we want to build next.</p>]]></content><author><name>Khanh Dang</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interviewing at Google was more than just a hiring process ‚Äî it became a journey of self-reflection, testing my ability to think, communicate, and grow under pressure.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Case Study: Mobile App Marketing &amp;amp; Conversion Analysis</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/04/21/mobile-app-marketing-conversion-analysis.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Case Study: Mobile App Marketing &amp;amp; Conversion Analysis" /><published>2025-04-21T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2025-04-21T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/04/21/mobile-app-marketing-conversion-analysis</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/04/21/mobile-app-marketing-conversion-analysis.html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>

<h1 id="2-user-behavior-analysis">2. User Behavior Analysis</h1>

<p><strong>üéØ Goal:</strong> Identify high-converting in-app actions and behavioral patterns among different user types.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Screenshot_Mobile App_02.png" alt="User Behavior Dashboard Screenshot" width="800" /></p>

<h3 id="-key-visualizations-1">üìä Key Visualizations</h3>

<p><strong>1. Engagement Metrics Table</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Converted users tend to have more sessions and spend more time per session, showing deeper engagement.</li>
  <li>Non-converted users use the app more frequently (higher average days used) but spend less time overall, likely testing limited features (such as invoice creation or bank connections) that are restricted in the free plan.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Feature Usage Funnel</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Many users begin with basic features like <strong>Create Expense/Invoice</strong> or <strong>Enter Tax Number</strong>.</li>
  <li>Fewer users proceed to advanced tasks such as <strong>PEPPOL Registration</strong>, <strong>VAT Input</strong>, or <strong>IBAN Setup</strong>.</li>
  <li>These drop-offs may suggest:
    <ul>
      <li>UX friction or complexity</li>
      <li>Lack of onboarding or tooltips</li>
      <li>Users feeling overwhelmed with tax-related setup</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Conversion Rate by Feature Used (100% Stacked Bar Chart)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Although fewer users use features like <strong>IBAN Setup</strong>, <strong>Verified Bank</strong>, and <strong>PEPPOL Registration</strong>, those who do are far more likely to become paid users.<br />
‚Üí These actions suggest serious engagement and a high intent to fully use the platform.</li>
  <li><strong>AI Assistant</strong> has a moderate conversion rate (~71.7%).</li>
  <li>Frequently used basic features such as <strong>Create Expense</strong>, <strong>Invoice</strong>, or <strong>Other Revenue</strong> have lower conversion rates.<br />
‚Üí These are often used for quick testing by new or casual users without further exploration.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. First Feature Used Distribution</strong><br />
Shows which feature users interacted with first after installing the app.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most users start with simpler actions such as <strong>Create Expense</strong> or <strong>Create Invoice</strong>.</li>
  <li>Fewer users begin with advanced or guided features, which mirrors the behavior seen in the usage funnel.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Conversion Rate by First Feature Used</strong><br />
Highlights how the first action impacts conversion likelihood.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users who start with <strong>AI Assistant</strong> have the highest conversion rate (40%), despite being a smaller group.</li>
  <li>Users who start with simpler features tend to explore less, leading to lower conversion.<br />
‚Üí When users take the time to explore the app fully and engage with its features, they have a higher chance of becoming paying subscribers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-insights-1">üîç Insights</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Early drop-offs in the usage funnel suggest onboarding friction.</li>
  <li>Users who adopt financial tools or AI early are more likely to convert.</li>
  <li>Conversion is influenced not only by feature use, but by the order and timing of use.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-recommendations-1">‚úÖ Recommendations</h3>

<p><strong>Onboarding Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Add tooltips and onboarding prompts for advanced features.</li>
  <li>Guide users to the next helpful action after they perform a basic action. For example, if they create an invoice, suggest connecting their bank account.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AI Assistant Optimization</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduce a required (but skippable) first interaction with the AI Assistant.</li>
  <li>Use the Assistant to guide users through onboarding (e.g., suggesting VAT input after tax number entry).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Incentives and Retention</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Offer a 14-day trial to users who connect a bank but don‚Äôt convert.</li>
  <li>Send personalized in-app nudges to re-engage users who drop off early in the funnel.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1. Conversion Speed Breakdown</strong><br />
Among converted users, 10.4% converted immediately ‚Äî meaning they subscribed on the first or second day of using the app.</p>

<p><strong>2. Time to Pay Distribution</strong><br />
Most users convert within the <strong>first 1‚Äì2 months</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>3‚Äì5. Marketing Channel Performance</strong><br />
Evaluation by user volume, conversion rate, and maximum MRR:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google</strong> brings in the largest volume of users, top MRR, but moderate conversion.</li>
  <li><strong>Facebook</strong> achieves the highest conversion rate, surpassing Google and TikTok, despite having moderate user traffic and MRR.</li>
  <li><strong>TikTok</strong> exhibits the lowest performance across user volume, conversion rate, and MRR, indicating overall underperformance.</li>

  <li>Promocode usage significantly boosts both conversion rate and conversion speed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-insights-2">üîç Insights</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Social media (e.g., Facebook):</strong> Demonstrates strong conversion rates and contributes significantly to revenue, suggesting a highly engaged audience. Consider further investment and scaling successful creatives.</li>
  <li><strong>Search engine (Google):</strong> While generating the highest user volume and MRR, search engine campaigns show a moderate conversion rate, indicating potential for optimization through improved keyword targeting and landing page relevance.</li>
  <li><strong>Short-form video (TikTok):</strong> Currently underperforming across key metrics (user volume, conversion, MRR), potentially due to a mismatch between the platform‚Äôs demographics and our target audience. A carefully targeted experiment is recommended before further investment.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-recommendations-2">‚úÖ Recommendations</h3>

<p><strong>Channel Strategy:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Increase budget to leverage its high conversion rates.</li>
  <li><strong>Google:</strong> Optimize for better conversion by focusing on top campaigns (SEA), refining keyword targeting, and improving ad and landing page relevance.</li>
  <li><strong>TikTok:</strong> Conduct a focused final experiment targeting people aged 25-35 who are interested in business, finance, and freelance topics, using content that addresses their pain points, before considering a budget cut.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Campaign Tactics:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prioritize High ROI:</strong> Allocate more budget to campaigns demonstrating strong return (e.g., SEA, Static).</li>
  <li><strong>Explore High-Potential:</strong> Monitor and test scaling campaigns with high conversion rates but low volume (e.g., Retargeting, Organic).</li>
  <li><strong>Drive Faster Conversion:</strong> Implement limited-time promos to encourage quicker subscriptions.</li>

‚û°Ô∏è Maintain or slightly increase marketing investment in these regions.<br />
‚û°Ô∏è Implement A/B testing of new and innovative campaign ideas to further optimize performance and unlock additional user acquisition and revenue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mecklenburg-Vorpommern &amp; Hamburg</strong> has fewer users, but strong conversion efficiency.<br />
‚û°Ô∏è Explore growth potential by implementing targeted, low-budget awareness campaigns to increase user acquisition. Initial small investments could yield efficient returns.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Screenshot_Mobile App_04b.png" alt="Self-Employment Status" width="800" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The majority identifies as self-employed, confirming strong alignment with the app‚Äôs intended target audience.</li>
  <li>A smaller segment comprises individuals who are not currently self-employed, potentially representing:
    <ul>
      <li>Users exploring the app out of general interest.</li>
      <li>Individuals in the process of preparing to become self-employed.</li>
      <li>A potential secondary market that could be further explored.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>‚û°Ô∏è Continue prioritizing marketing and feature development for the core self-employed user base.<br />
‚û°Ô∏è Consider developing introductory or informational content tailored to the ‚Äúpre-freelancer‚Äù segment to nurture potential future users.</p>

<h3 id="c-profession-based-segmentation">c. Profession-Based Segmentation</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Artists &amp; Content Creators</strong> are the largest group and generate the highest Max MRR (due to size). However, their conversion rate is not the highest among all professions, indicating an opportunity for improvement. The high MRR is primarily driven by the sheer volume of users in this category.</li>
  <li><strong>Disparity between Volume and Conversion</strong>: Notably, the professions with the highest number of users are not necessarily the same as those with the highest conversion rates. This highlights the need for a nuanced approach to targeting.</li>

<h1 id="final-takeaways">üìå Final Takeaways</h1>

<p>This case study showed how integrating behavioral analytics and marketing performance can drive better user acquisition and retention. The combination of funnel tracking, feature analysis, and campaign ROI offers a blueprint for optimizing app growth strategies. By leveraging interactive dashboards and a structured analysis approach, we uncovered several key insights:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Feature engagement drives conversion</strong>: Users who interact with advanced financial tools or the AI Assistant show significantly higher conversion rates. These features signal strong intent and deeper engagement.</li>
  <li><strong>The onboarding experience is crucial</strong>: Conversion likelihood is heavily influenced by the first feature users engage with. Early exposure to guided or advanced functionality leads to higher subscription rates.</li>
  <li><strong>Marketing ROI varies by Channel</strong>: Facebook delivers the strongest conversion performance, while TikTok underperforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Regional performance varies significantly</strong>: Berlin leads regionally with the highest conversion rate and MRR.</li>
  <li><strong>Profession &amp; VAT status</strong> influence conversion behavior, pointing to the value of profession-specific messaging and features for VAT-registered users.</li>
  <li><strong>Dual-income users</strong> (e.g., freelancers with a main job) show the highest conversion rates and are an emerging high-value segment.</li>
</ul>

<p>‚û°Ô∏è <strong>Next steps:</strong> We need to make the initial experience for new users better, focus more on the marketing that works best (like Facebook in strong regions), and try different ways to connect with users based on how they use the app and where they are. We‚Äôll keep tracking these things to make sure we keep growing effectively.</p>]]></content><author><name>Khanh Dang</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This case study explores how different marketing channels and user behaviors influence conversion rates for a mobile app targeting self-employed professionals in Germany.]]></summary></entry></feed>
