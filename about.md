I'm a data analyst with 3+ years of hands-on experience turning raw data into meaningful insights that drive smarter decisions.

To me, data isn’t just numbers—it’s a story waiting to be uncovered. I've worked in financial services and business consulting, collaborating with experts and delivering impact through data processing, analytics, and visualization. 

Fueled by curiosity and a love for continuous learning, I'm diving deeper into Machine Learning and advanced data storytelling techniques. Whether in a fast-paced startup or a global enterprise, I bring analytical rigor, creativity, and a collaborative mindset to every team I join.
