## üìå Overview
This case study analyzes user behavior and marketing performance for a mobile app targeting self-employed professionals in Germany, using data from 2020 to 2025. The goal is to optimize conversion rates to paid subscriptions and improve acquisition efficiency. The dataset includes 29,100 users (15.1% conversion rate) with details on sign-up dates, in-app events, professions, subscription plans, and marketing sources, all focused on the German market.

We built four interactive dashboards in Looker Studio to visualize key metrics and uncover actionable insights:

1. **Overview:** High-level performance metrics and conversion trends.
2. **User Behavior Analysis**
3. **Marketing Performance:** Effectiveness of acquisition channels.
4. **User Segmentation & Targeting:** Behavioral and demographic segmentation.

## üîß Tools & Methods
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Python
- **Visualization:** Looker Studio (Google Data Studio)
- **Data Source:** Internal app analytics (e.g., user events, subscription dates, marketing sources).

- **Line Graph:** Displays monthly sign-ups and conversions (2020‚Äì2025)
- **Bar Chart:** Compares session counts for converted vs. non-converted users

**Insights:**
- Conversion bottlenecks occur early, with many users dropping off before engaging with key features
- Converted users have higher session frequencies and complete onboarding steps faster

**Recommendations:**

- **Bar Chart:** Feature usage (e.g., invoice creation, AI interactions) by user type
- **Heatmap:** Conversion rates by user profession
- **Time Series:** Average time to conversion for key actions

**Insights:**
