## üìå Overview

This case study explores user behavior and marketing performance for a mobile app designed for self-employed professionals in Germany. Using data from 2020 to 2025, the goal was to improve conversion rates to paid subscriptions and optimize acquisition efficiency.

The dataset covers **29.1k users** (15.1% conversion rate), capturing sign-up dates, in-app actions, profession types, subscription choices, and marketing sources.

I created **four interactive dashboards in Looker Studio** to visualize KPIs and uncover insights:

1. **Overview:** High-level performance metrics and conversion trends  
2. **User Behavior Analysis**  
3. **Marketing Performance**  
4. **User Segmentation & Targeting**

## üîß Tools & Methods

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Python  
- **Visualization:** Looker Studio (Google Data Studio)  
- **Data Source:** Internal app analytics (user events, subscriptions, acquisition data)

## üìä Dashboard Breakdown & Insights

### 1. Overview Dashboard  
**Goal:** Provide a high-level snapshot of user growth, conversion trends, and subscription revenue over time.

**Key Visualizations:**
- **KPI Cards:** Total users (29.1k), Conversion Rate (15.1%), Total Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- **Pie Charts:** Conversion Status Breakdown (Free vs. Paid), Paid vs. Non-paid Conversion
- **Line Charts:** Account Creation Timeline, Monthly New subscribers

**Insights:**
- Steady user growth from 2020 to 2025 indicates increasing brand visibility and app popularity.
- Paid User Breakdown: Among users who converted, this chart shows:
  - Paid: Users who subscribed without using a free trial (77.1% of Converted users).
  - Non-paid: Users who first tried the app with a free trial and then subscribed (22.9% of Converted users).
- July‚ÄìSeptember 2024 shows a noticeable spike in non-paid conversions, raising important questions:
  - Was there a large-scale marketing campaign that boosted sign-ups but didn‚Äôt convert well?
  - Could a free trial promotion have led to a surge in trial users who didn't upgrade?
  - Was the audience mismatch? (e.g., students testing features, or users from countries where payment is unsupported)

**Recommendations:**
- Investigate campaign strategies and audience sources during this spike period.
- Analyze user segments to determine if trial experiences or onboarding flows contributed to lower paid conversion.
- Cross-check app store reviews or feedback during this time for additional context.
